        I also really loved going to Gradma's, so I sat there not knowing what to do for a long minute. I eventually decided to go
        to Grandma's, but I still wonder to this day if you would have actually bought me one if I'd decided to stay home, or if you
        would have just made me go to Gradma's anyways and you were just trying to see which I wanted more -Sarah`,
