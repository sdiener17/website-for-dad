        clogged toilets, or less tangible things, like helping me work through my major change, you're good at fixing things.`,
    text1 : `I remember how the boys and I would go upstairs and create "monster dark", which meant we tried to make it as dark
        in the hallway as we could, even to the point of stuffing towels and blankets in the cracks of the doors. Then, sometimes, we
        would take the tub of balls and have two of us stand at the top of the stairs with one at the bottom, and the two at the top
        would dumpt the tub of balls down on the person below. We thought it was a lot of fun being bombarded by balls, so we all took
        turns doing it. It was loud when all the balls came tumbling down the stairs, especially when they all hit the door. So you would
        always pop your head in and tell us to stop. We'd say "okay", then do it again. It was probably really annoying to listen to all
        those balls coming tumbling down the stairs, and you probably didn't want us to damage the door, but we never really understood
        why you didn't want us to do it, especially since it was one of the few times we all were getting along and staying out of your
        way :)`,
    text2:`I remember you reading books to us, particularly the book 'Flip'. I don't know why I loved that book so much, but, in my
        limited memory, I seemed to choose it a lot. It got to the point where I knew how the book went, and you started changing it,
        and I would get annoyed with you everytime and tell you that that wasn't how the book went. Even though it's been years and years
        since I've heard the book read to me, when I pulled it off the shelf recently, I still had a vague recollection of how it
        went.`,
