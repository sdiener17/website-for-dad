        all that you have done for me throughout the years, even things that I don’t remember. You have sacrificed so much time 
        and energy to help me grow up into the man that I am today and without you I wouldn’t be where I am right now. You have 
        taught me so much about being a responsible, honest, and loving man just from seeing how you live your life and from things 
        you have told me. Love thinking back to all the good memories of beating you in ping pong, driving ATVs in the wilderness 
        with you, shooting hoops in the driveway, and many more! Love you and have a great Father’s Day!`
